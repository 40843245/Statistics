# Bias
## Category
In statistics, it can be divided into the following types.

+ Sampling bias
  - Sample bias
+ Observation bias
+ Explaination bias
+ Confirmation bias

### Sampling bias
Biases caused by sampling defects.

Consider questions about sampling.
+ Is the source of sample random?
+ Is the number of sample large enough?

#### Sample bias

Bias caused by the small number of sample.

In statistics, some distribution are ONLY eligible for a sample size greater than 30.

### Observer bias
Observers process the data in different ways to get different results.

### Interpreting biases
Because the interpreter interprets the statistical analysis results in different ways.

### Confirmation bias
Before the study began, the researchers had a preconceived idea of what they wanted to achieve and consciously collected the relevant data so that the results would meet the expectations of those people.

## Subclass
+ Self-serving bias

> Have you ever heard the elders often say, "It's better to be a crab than not to be a crab, how hard we used to be, but today's young people are really too weak (1000 words deleted)..."
> Self-interest bias refers to the tendency to elevate oneself (or one's own identity group) and belittle others (or others' identity group) in psychology.

+ Fundamental attribution error (FAE)

> Have you ever encountered any of the following:
> + The newspaper mentions that a girl who went to a nightclub was insulted, and the victim would be said, "Who told her to go to a nightclub? It must be dressed very sexy, that's why it's a crime!".
> + When it was mentioned in the newspapers that a person died accidentally while traveling with a parachute, that person would be said, "If you don't know how to play with a parachute, don't play it, and it will make your family sad."

> [!NOTE]
> person as an observer, tends to attribute the cause of what happens to someone else, especially bad things, to that person's inner qualities. All the fault is because of your own bad and has nothing to do with anything else.
>> For example:
>> + You fail because you're stupid.
>> + You were raped because you were wearing too little.
>> + You were hit and killed because you were not safety conscious.
>> + Your academic performance is bad because you are lazy.

+ actor-observer bias

> [!NOTE]
> When we interpret human behavior, the attribution tendency is the exact opposite when we are actors and observers, which deduces human bias.
> In the case of failure, when you are an actor, you tend to attribute your own failures to external factors, but when you are an observer, you tend to attribute the failures of others to his internal factors.
>> For example:
>> When you see a friend fail in business, how do you tend to explain your friend's failure as an observer? You say, "Maybe it's because he doesn't know how to do business, or maybe he's not born with a personality to do business." You attribute your friend's failures to his internal attribution. On the other hand, if you are the one who is losing the business right now, and you are an actor, when you are asked why you are failing, you will tend to answer, "Because I have no one to help me, because I am so unlucky." You attribute your failures to external attribution.
